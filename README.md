      <li>How would you debug a memory leak in a production Java application?</li>
      <li>Your service is experiencing intermittent timeouts. What steps would you take to identify the root cause?</li>
      <li>Disk I/O is spiking on your database server. What could be the causes and how would you investigate?</li>
      <li>An API endpoint is much slower than others. How would you profile and optimize it?</li>
      <li>Your application crashes under high load but runs fine under low load. What‚Äôs your investigation plan?</li>
